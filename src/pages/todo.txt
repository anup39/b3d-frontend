Things i was working from our last meeting on Octobor 6 , Friday :
1) Fixed issues where we were unable to see the category geometry in the Map
2) Issues when unselecting categories for specific project http://137.135.165.161/manage-classes/
3) Showing list of Geotiffs uploaded to particular project (in DashBoard)
4) Uploading progress bar for Geotiffs
5) Smooth Performance  for Geotiffs rendering (still working this week)
6) Now one project have multiple Geotiffs but it should be uploaded one by one
7) Changing opacity of geometry in Map
8) Project deployed to the server (setup)

For uplaoding Geotiff you can test with this file attached below. For Geotiff upload the file must have extension of .tiff
Only RGB (3 bands , true color ) georefrenced image will work properly. so if you any requirement let me know i will change accordingly . 
For example if you want 1 band (gray color) to  show im map let me know.
Also try with some geotiffs and let me know if there is any problem and provide me sample because i have not testes for geotiffs with different projections and  i will test and improve this part this week also.

Things i will do this week from Octobor 10 :
1) Geotiffs testing with samples (varied projection) and Performance enchancement
2) categories with able to draw and save for LineString and Point geometry also
